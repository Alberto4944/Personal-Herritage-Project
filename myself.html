            I was born in Towson, Maryland, US in 2009, on Canada Day (July 1st). We moved out of the US about 2 years after I was born, and because I only lived in the US for only ~1/6 of my life, the American culture hasn't really affected me that much. My family lived in the USA for only around 1 - 1.5 years before I was born, so my entire family isn't really considered American. I still acknowledge that my birthday is on Canada Day, and I am born in the US in Towson, but since it isn't really major, I just think of it for fun. For example, no one in Canada or the US would say "Oh look, that's an American!"</p>

            After we moved from the US, we travelled all the way to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, where I currently live. So if you count my age, I have lived here for ~11 years. Canada has been a pretty big influence on me, but not that much on my parents. Both my parents are from China, and grew up there, but I have lived here for almost all my life, so it has changed me a lot. Many everyday things come from an Asian perspective, and the others come from a western view. Examples from Canada include: hockey/skating, weather, english, and some foods (such as pancakes).</p>

            China definitely has a big impact on my perception of the world. Both of my parents and sister were born in China. At home, it was always me, two parents, and my sister; all around me was chinese culture. As I grew up, I realized that the reason why the stereotype of "All Chinese people are "smart", that people believe, isn't because we are born "smart"; but that our parents push us harder and to do more. We celebrate traditional holidays, such as Chinese New Year, cook/bake chinese foods and play chinese sports/games (such as table tennis or chinese poker).</p>

            Overall, my family and siblings have affected me a lot. It's a big thing because I was born in the US, live in Canada right now, but my culture has pretty much all come from China. When I think of myself, I even have troubles understanding where i'm from. Even though I am from all places across the board, China definitely has the biggest influence on me right now, since it's all around me when i'm with my family. I always say that i'm a dual citizen (US & CAN), but it doesn't really feel like I really am a Canadian, or an American. I wasn't born in China, but since my family is from China, it feels like it dominates. In conclusion, I am a boy who is from around the world, but China has the biggest influence.
