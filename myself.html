            I was born in Towson, Maryland, US in 2009, on Canada Day (July 1st). We moved out of the US about 2 years after I was born, and because I only lived in the US for only ~1/6 of my life, the American culture hasn't really affected me that much. My family lived in the USA for only around 1 - 1.5 years before I was born, so my entire family isn't really considered American. I still acknowledge that my birthday is on Canada Day, but born in the US.</p>

            After we moved from the US, we travelled all the way to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, where I currently live. So if you count my age, I have lived here for ~11 years. Canada has been a pretty big influence on me, but not that much on my parents. Both my parents are from China, and grew up there, but I have lived here for almost all my life, so it has changed me a lot. Many everyday things come from an Asian perspective, and the others come from a western view. Examples from Canada include: hockey/skating, weather, english, and some foods (such as pancakes).</p>

            China has definitely had the biggest impact on my perspective and life. Both my parents, and my sister, were born in China. Even though I currently live in Canada, you parents make the biggest influence on you as you grow up. At home, it was always me, my two parents, and my sister (now isn't here), so all around me was chinese culture. My parents have brought over a lot of chinese "knowledge", which is very interesting. We celebrate traditional holidays, such as Chinese New Year, cook and bake chinese/asian foods and play chinese sports/games (such as table tennis or chinese poker).</p>

            Overall, my family and siblings have affected me a lot. It's a big thing because I was born in the US, live in Canada right now, but my culture has pretty much all came from China. When I think of myself, I even have troubles understanding where i'm from. Even though it is from all places across the board, China definitely has the biggest influence on me right now, because it's all around me when i'm with my family. I always say that i'm a dual citizen (which I am: US & CAN), but it doesn't really feel like I really am a Canadian, or an American. I wasn't born in China, but because my family is from China, it fells like that dominates. In conclusion, I am a boy who is scattered across the world, but China has the biggest impact.
