        <span><class class="asas">In conclusion</class>, my family heritage is put as a Chinese world perspective but has some Canadian/American bits in it. Chinese culture dominates my identity with it impacting me in many ways. As I grow up, the impact of my parents and grandparents will become more prominent as we gain the role of <b>leadership</b>, in the way of having children. Family history is important in understanding your <b>true</b> identity, what makes you, to be <b>proud</b> of who you are, and to be able to continue the journey of past knowledge and experiences to the next generations.</span>
